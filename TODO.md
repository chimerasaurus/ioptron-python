There's a lot to do. :)

# Big stuff
- [ ] Implement most, or all, of the functions in the spec
- [ ] Refactor the classes into a proper Python package
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Logging and error handling


# Medium stuff
- [ ] Handle serial in a more platform-agnosic way
- [ ] Use YAML config to simplify some of the functions
- [ ] Clean up samples and put them in their own directory
- [ ] Tests that are not just the samples
